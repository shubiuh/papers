This paper is similar to FEM+AD which can use the Pytorch/tensorflow to build the training process more quickly than traditional solver. The examples which are all toy
examples show good results. However, the last example which has partially observed data shows a long iteration numbers to get converged results. This method is not novel
but just use FEM+AD to compare with PINN. The application in industry-size problem is not promising.
